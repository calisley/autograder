# Part 1: Taylor Swift Tix!!! [12 points]

Pop star Taylor Swift concluded her record-breaking Eras tour in Vancouver, British Columbia, last weekend. Swift played 149 shows in dozens of cities around the world. Tickets purchased from Swift directly were expensive – but they sold for even more on the secondary (i.e, resale) market.

The Economist recently gathered data on Eras tour ticket resale prices. The Economist’s graphic is below.

https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2024/12/06/taylor-swift-imperfect-capitalist

Based on the figure, please respond to the following True/False/Uncertain questions. For each answer, provide a brief explanation. [1-2 sentences]

For example, the statement “October has 31 days” is true. The statement “October has 30 days” is false. The statement “it will rain next October” is uncertain because we do not have enough information to answer.

[4 points] True/False/Uncertain: 50% of ticket resale prices for the shows in Indianapolis were at least $1,371 each.

TRUE

FALSE

UNCERTAIN


<table>
<tr>
<td>Explanation: The definition of a median is that 50% of observations are above it, 50% are below it.</td>
</tr>
</table>


[4 points] True/False/Uncertain: The mean resale price in every city represented in the graph is higher than the city’s median resale price.

TRUE

FALSE

UNCERTAIN


<table>
<tr>
<td>Explanation: Any of these responses is reasonable provided that a strong justification is provided. We know that when data have a long tail to the right (i.e., is “right-skewed”), the mean—which is more sensitive to outliers—will be greater than the median. Most of the ticket resale prices in each city do seem to be this way, but we can’t say for sure whether this is true in each city. For example, Rio de Janeiro is harder to eyeball.</td>
</tr>
</table>


[4 points] Some venues in Europe placed a limit on ticket resale prices. True/False/Uncertain: The figure proves that caps on resale prices work to constrain resale prices.

TRUE

FALSE

UNCERTAIN


<table>
<tr>
<td>Explanation: Either False or Uncertain is a reasonable response. We don’t know — cities in Europe do seem to have lower prices on average than in North America but that could be for a number of reasons. For example, the US could just have higher-than-average prices (and everywhere else in the world, including Europe, has lower ones) due, for example, to customer demand and Swift’s (relative) popularity. Regardless of the reason, we’re unable to make causal claims using these charts alone.</td>

# Part 2: Medicaid, continued [27 points]

You may recall from class that Medicaid is a public health insurance program in the United States providing coverage to those with low incomes. It is jointly run by the U.S. federal government and the states. The Affordable Care Act (enacted in 2010) expanded access to Medicaid. Ultimately, each state had to choose whether to expand Medicaid in its state.

A recent study evaluated how mortality changed in U.S. states that chose to expand access to Medicaid. The primary outcome was the annual, state-level counts of deaths per 100,000 adults by any cause. Note that this was not a lottery-based experiment like the Oregon Health Study; it is instead a descriptive “observational” study that compared mortality rates before and after Medicaid expansion.

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00252-8/fulltext

Below is a figure from the paper. The chart shows the change in all-cause mortality in states that expanded Medicaid. The horizontal axis is the change in mortality from before Medicaid expansion to after Medicaid expansion. A positive change means morality increased after Medicaid expansion. A negative change means mortality decreased after Medicaid expansion. For each state, the estimate of the change in mortality is a dot, and the 95% confidence interval is the line. (Note: Because the authors used a different technique to calculate 95% CIs than we did in API-201, the estimates are not always in the middle of the confidence intervals. Besides this quirk, the confidence intervals have the same interpretation and behavior as in API-201.)

[5 points] The “Overall” result is at the bottom of the figure. (“Overall” is for all 26 states that expanded Medicaid and were analyzed in the study.) What is the 95% confidence interval for the change in all-cause mortality overall after Medicaid expansion? Explain the confidence interval in language that a policymaker can understand (you do not need to discuss statistical significance). [1-2 sentences]


<table>
<tr>
<td>Reading from the figure, the 95% CI is [-21.3, -2.2]; the point estimate is -11.8. For a policymaker, we can say: “We’re fairly confident that the true difference in all-cause mortality in states that expanded Medicaid as compared to those that did not is between -21.3 and -2.2 per 100,000 people.” As we discussed in class, there are other equally valid ways to describe a confidence interval to a policymaker; refer back to the handouts for the language.</td>
</tr>
</table>


[4 points] True/False/Uncertain: The estimate for Rhode Island (the first state in the figure) is statistically significant at the 10% level.

TRUE

FALSE

UNCERTAIN


<table>
<tr>
<td>Explanation [1-2 sentences]: True — because we rejected the null at the 5% level (as indicated by the fact that the CI doesn’t include 0), we know we will also reject it at the 10% level as well (or any threshold greater than 5%).</td>
</tr>
</table>


[6 points] True/False/Uncertain: All-cause mortality in New Mexico (the last state in the figure) stayed roughly the same.

TRUE

FALSE

UNCERTAIN


<table>
<tr>
<td>Explanation [2-3 sentences]: All three responses are reasonable given a strong justification. The important thing to note is that the confidence interval for all-cause mortality in New Mexico includes 0, which indicates that we cannot distinguish between sampling fluctuations and an actual change. However, the confidence interval contains a very wide range of plausible values, so it is difficult to tell if mortality “stayed the same” or not. This indicates that there is not a great deal of information to be taken from this study. Note that one could say that the change is not statistically significant; however it would not be a complete interpretation to say there was no change (i.e. that there was a “precise zero”) because of the width of the confidence interval.</td>
</tr>
</table>


[12 points] The authors conclude that, “Medicaid expansion remains associated with significant reductions in all-cause mortality.” Based only on the evidence in the figure above, how compelling do you find the author’s claims? In your response, make at least three distinct observations about the results and underline them. [1-2 paragraphs]


<table>
<tr>
<td>A good response recognizes that some of the findings are compelling, but also includes questions about the overall conclusions we’re able to come to: The findings are compelling in that we see a statistically significant overall decrease in all-cause mortality One could argue that this is a practically significant overall change because any reduction in mortality—an already rare/extreme outcome—is practical. (However, this point would be stronger if we knew the baseline level of all-cause mortality pre-ACA and could calculate the overall reduction in mortality by taking the point estimate for the difference and dividing it by the original rate) While a good portion of the confidence intervals don’t include 0 (indicating a statistically significant association), several do, which could lead us to conclude that the study has overall mixed results. Alternatively, the width of the confidence intervals may imply that we do not have sufficient power to detect practically meaningful differences. Relatedly, the point estimates are negative and positive (still with confidence intervals including 0), which could be interpreted as more evidence of mixed results</td>

# Part 3: Job search [24 points]

Your friend Danica, an MPP2, is quite analytical (thanks in part to taking API-201 last year, of course). She is job hunting. During her job search, she expects to receive exactly two job offers, one at a time. After receiving the first job offer (during what she calls “Round 1”), she will have to make a decision about whether to accept or reject it. If she accepts the first job offer, her job search will end. If she rejects the first job offer, she will proceed to what she calls “Round 2,” during which she will get a second job offer. She must then decide whether to accept or reject the second offer. No matter what she decides in Round 2, her job search will end.

Danica has classified jobs into four types based on job quality, as shown in the table below. She carefully determined her utility for each type of job and the probability that a job she is offered is of a specific quality. For her, the utility of having no job is zero. Her utility values take into account her attitudes toward risk. Danica only cares about maximizing her expected utility.


<table>
<tr>
<td>Job quality</td>
<td>Probability</td>
<td>Danica’s utility</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Poor</td>
<td>10%</td>
<td>-1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fair</td>
<td>20%</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Good</td>
<td>40%</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Excellent</td>
<td>30%</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
</table>


[4 points] Suppose Danica is offered a “Good” job in Round 2. Should she accept or reject it? Explain and show your work.


<table>
<tr>
<td>If she accepts: Utility(“good” job in Round 2) = 2 If she rejects: Utility(no job in Round 2) = 0 Because she cares about maximizing her utility, she should take the job.</td>
</tr>
</table>


[6 points] Suppose Danica is offered a “Good” job in Round 1. Should she accept or reject it? Explain and show your work.


<table>
<tr>
<td>Utility(“good” job in Round 1) = 2 In Round 2, Danica still gets a lower utility from a “Poor” job than from no job, so in the event that she is offered a Poor job, she will instead choose no job, with a utility of zero. Otherwise she will take any other job offer in Round 2: Expected utility(any job in Round 2) = (0.10*0) + (0.20*1) + (0.40*2) + (0.30*4) = 2.2 Because she cares about maximizing her expected utility, she should reject the “good” job in Round 1.</td>
</tr>
</table>


[5 points] Danica explains that there is a 7% chance that she gets a job offer in each round but ends up without a job. Her parents are both surprised and horrified by this possibility. Explain why it makes sense based on the information above. [2-3 sentences]


<table>
<tr>
<td>Danica will reject any offer in Round 1 if the offer is not “excellent,” because she cares about maximizing her expected utility. From question 9 above, we know that her expected utility of any job from Round 2 is 2.2; this expected utility is greater than her utility from every other outcome in round 1, except for getting an “excellent” job. So, if she gets a job offer in Round 1 and that offer isn’t “excellent,” she won’t take it. There’s a 70% chance this happens. Then, if she gets to Round 2, she would also reject a job offer if it is “poor,” because that would give her negative utility; she’d rather have no job because she’d get more utility from it than having a “poor” job. There is a 10% chance this happens. 70% times 10% is 7%. These choices correspond to the following probabilities: P(Round 1 = [1-P(“excellent” job offer)]) * P(Round 2 = “poor” job offer) = 0.70*0.10 = 7%</td>
</tr>
</table>


[5 points] You believe that Danica has overestimated the quality of the job offer that she will get in Round 2. (You expect that the job offer in Round 2 will be of lower quality on average.) If you are correct, how could that affect her decision making in Round 1? Under what specific circumstances? Explain. [2-3 sentences]


<table>
<tr>
<td>Original expected utility of Round 2 = (0.10*0) + (0.20*1) + (0.40*2) + (0.30*4) = 2.2 Whether Danica rejects the job offer in Round 1 depends on her expected utility from the job offer she will receive in Round 2. With the original expected utility from Round 2 above, she would only accept the job offer in Round 1 if it was an “excellent” job. If she overestimated the quality of the job offer that she will get in Round 2, she may be more willing to take a lower-quality job in Round 1. Specifically: If her overall expected utility from Round 2 is equal to exactly 2, then she would be indifferent between accepting a “good” job offer in Round 1 and moving to Round 2. If her expected utility from Round 2 is less than 2 and but greater than 1, she would accept at least a “good” job offer in Round 1. If her expected utility from Round 2 is less than 1 but above 0, she’d accept at least a “fair” job offer in Round 1. Note that she will never accept a “poor” job offer, because that would give her negative utility, and she’d rather have no job (0 utility) than a “poor” job with negative utility.</td>

[4 points] Having to make irreversible decisions in sequence is a common problem in decision theory. Explain how to apply the lessons from this Part to one of the following situations. In particular, explain how your decision making strategy may evolve over time.

[Choose ONE of the following]

Selling a used item on Facebook Marketplace, where each potential buyer makes an offer.

Buying a condo in a “hot” real estate market, in which you must decide whether to buy immediately after seeing a particular property.

Searching for a life partner


<table>
<tr>
<td>Explanation [2-3 sentences]: Two insights from the previous questions (but not necessarily the only two) are: One’s decision making standard can change as “rounds” of decisions proceed; in the situation above, Danica would not accept a “Good” job in Round 1 but would accept a “Good” job in Round 2; and New information about the quality of choices in Round 2 can affect decision making in earlier rounds. You can apply these lessons to any of the three situations listed here. Here are some possible answers: When selling an item on Facebook Marketplace, you do not know how much you will be offered for your item. You may set a higher standard earlier in the process, only accepting an offer if it exceeds a certain threshold. But as time goes on, you may lower the threshold offer that you will accept. When searching for a condo in a hot real estate market, you can’t really shop around but need to make an offer immediately. Earlier in your search, you may set a high standard and make an offer only if the condo is great. But later in the search, if you haven’t found a condo yet, you may lower your standards and offer to buy a condo that you merely like. Moreover, if you learn that the quality of condos available on the market is lower than you thought, you should be more willing make an offer on a lower-quality unit earlier in the process. Similarly, it is sensible early in your search for a life partner to set a high standard. But if you are later in the process, and have not found your partner yet, you may (ahem) adjust your standards. Moreover, if you learn that the quality of potential partners is lower than expected in later rounds, you may adjust your decision making earlier in the process.</td>

# Part 4: Inflation [15 points]

Inflation has affected people around the world in recent years. Policymakers have tools with which to respond to inflation. But how do they know that inflation is coming so they can respond in advance? Researchers have spent considerable time trying to identify “leading” indicators of inflationary pressure.

One such indicator in the United States is a survey of consumers conducted by the University of Michigan. One question on the survey asks, “During the next 12 months, do you think that prices in general will go up, go down, or stay where they are now?” Responses to this question have been highly correlated with actual inflation three months later.

https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/fetchdoc.php?docid=24774.

30% of respondents to the most recent survey stated they expect prices to stay the same or go down over next 12 months. The sample size is 1,000 people. You can assume for simplicity that the sampling method was simple random sampling.

[5 points] Compute a 95% confidence interval for the percent of Americans who expect prices to stay the same or go down over next 12 months. Show your work.


<table>
<tr>
<td>The formula for calculating a 95% confidence interval is: estimate ± 2*SE 30% is a single proportion, so our standard error calculation is: q (1- q ) n (note we’re using q , not q , because 30% is our estimate). So to plug everything in we get: 0.30 ± 2* 0.30(1-0.300) 1,000 🡪 0.30 ± 2*0.0145 = [0.271, 0.329]</td>
</tr>
</table>


[4 points] Your colleague, who is smart but not well trained in statistics, asks you if the 95% confidence interval you computed in the previous question is “statistically significant.” How would you respond? [1-2 sentences]


<table>
<tr>
<td>In short, this statement doesn’t make sense: statistical significance must be relative to a null hypothesis, and there is no null hypothesis here. Confidence intervals have two uses: (1) to quantify the uncertainty surrounding an estimate, and (2) to use an estimate to test some claim (hypothesis testing). Deeming something as “statistically significant” (or not) is what we do when we’re testing a null hypothesis, which we aren’t doing here.</td>

Suppose it is 2021 and you are an economic policymaker in your country’s government. Inflation in your country will be either “High” or “Low,” but you do not know which it will be. You are concerned. Based on the best information available to you right now, you estimate that there is a 40% chance that inflation will actually be “High” and a 60% chance that inflation will actually be “Low.”

You then receive new survey results like the University of Michigan survey. Based on historical data, when inflation will actually be “High,” survey respondents on average say inflation will be “High” 70% of the time. Similarly, when inflation will actually be “Low,” survey respondents on average say inflation will be “Low” 90% of the time.

In the latest survey results, survey respondents in your country on average believe that inflation will be “High” in the next 12 months.

[6 points] Based on the new survey information, you double your estimate of the probability that inflation in your country will actually be “High” (from 40% to 80%). Is this sensible? Explain and show your work.


<table>
<tr>
<td>Let’s first write out everything we know: P(high inflation) = 0.40 P(low inflation) = 0.60 P(respondents say “high” | high inflation) = 0.70; P(respondents say “low” | low inflation) = 0.30 P(respondents say “low” | low inflation) = 0.90; P(respondents say “high” | low inflation) = 0.10 Then, we can fill in a two-by-two table: High inflation Low inflation Total Repondents say “high” 0.40*0.70*100 28 0.60*0.10*100 6 34 Respondents say “low” 0.40*0.30*100 12 0.60*0.90*100 54 66 Total 40 60 100 P(high inflation | respondents say “high”) = P(high inflation and respondents say “high) | high inflation = 28/34 = 82.4% Using Bayes’ formula: P ( high inflation | respondents say "high") = P ( "high" | high inflation ) *P(high inflation) P("high" | high inflation ) *P high inflation + P("high" | low inflation)*P(low inflation) = 0.70*0.40 (0.70*0.40) + (0.60*0.10) = 82.4% Yes, 80% is a sensible approximation.</td>

# Part 5: Smoking Cessation [22 points]

A recent study by Prof. Jenn Lerner of HKS examined how gratitude, as a “positive” emotion, impacts smoking cessation behavior. This is in contrast to “negative” emotions such as guilt or sadness. The study hypothesized that gratitude, compared to other emotions, would significantly reduce craving to smoke.

In her study, adult smokers were randomly assigned to either a “gratitude induction group” or a “neutral state group.” Participants in the gratitude group watched a video designed to evoke gratitude and wrote about a time they felt grateful, while the neutral group completed a non-emotional task. Craving to smoke was measured before and after the induction using validated self-report questions.

Below are the results of changes in self-reported craving (on a scale of 0 to 100) before and after the video and written task:


<table>
<tr>
<td>Change in craving following emotion induction</td>
<td>“Neutral” group</td>
<td>“Gratitude” group</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mean change (“craving after” minus “craving before”)</td>
<td>-0.75</td>
<td>-6.70</td>

<td>13.69</td>
<td>19.57</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Number of participants in each group</td>
<td>135</td>
<td>137</td>
</tr>
</table>


[6 points] Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference in change in craving between the Gratitude and Neutral groups.


<table>
<tr>
<td>Our hypothesis we’re testing here is that there’s no difference in the mean change in craving between the Gratitude in Neutral groups, which we represent by: H 0 : μ gratitutde - μ neutral =0 Our estimate is: -6.70- -0.75 =-5.95 The formula for calculating a 95% confidence interval is: estimate ± 2*SE Because this is a difference in means test, our standard error formula is: σ 1 2 n 1 + σ 2 2 n 2 (note that we use our estimates’ σ s in the SE formula because we don’t know the true values in the population) Plugging everything in, we get: -5.95±2* 13.69 2 135 + 19.57 2 137 🡪 -5.95±2*2.045= [–10.04, –1.86]</td>
</tr>
</table>


[4 points] What does this confidence interval suggest about the effectiveness of the gratitude condition as compared to the neutral condition? Be specific, using the language of hypothesis testing from API-201. [1-2 sentences]


<table>
<tr>
<td>Because our confidence interval does not contain 0 (our null), we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the true difference between the change in craving between the Gratitude and Neutral groups is 0, meaning that one intervention is more effective than the other (in this case, that Gratitude condition reduced cravings by more than the Neutral condition).</td>
</tr>
</table>


[6 points] What is the range of possible p-values for the null hypothesis that there is no difference between these groups?

p > 0.10

0.05 < p < 0.10

0.01 < p < 0.05

p < 0.01


<table>
<tr>
<td>Show your work (including calculations): We can test the same hypothesis we did above, by calculating the z-score and obtaining the associated p-value. To do this, we know the z-score calculation is:estimate-μ SE Z-score = -5.95-0 2.045 =-2.91 Because the absolute value of our z-score is &gt; 2.58 (the # of SDs from the mean that corresponds to an alpha level of 0.01), we know the p-value is &lt; 0.01.</td>
</tr>
</table>


[6 points] The authors also tested a third condition, which they called the “sadness” condition, where participants were reminded of the higher risk of illness and death associated with smoking. Respondents in the “sadness” group reported an increase in their craving to smoke of 6.24.

True/False/Uncertain: we can conclude that the difference between the change of cravings in the Gratitude group and the Sadness group is statistically significant.

TRUE

FALSE

UNCERTAIN


<table>
<tr>
<td>Explanation [2-3 sentences]: Either False or Uncertain is a reasonable response. To conclude that the difference between the change in the Sadness and Gratitude groups are statistically significant, we would need to do another difference in means test, like we did to assess the difference between the change in the Gratitude and Neutral groups. We would be able to do that calculation if we had the sample size for the Sadness group, and the standard deviation of the difference in the Sadness group. This estimate seems quite different from the change in the Gratitude group, however we aren’t able to say anything conclusive because we don’t know the size of the standard error. In this scenario, the Sadness group is so much farther away from the other groups, and in the wrong direction, that it is quite likely to be statistically significantly different, particularly if sample sizes remained similar. However, we cannot be sure without conducting a test.</td>
