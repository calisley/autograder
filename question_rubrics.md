   - Example: "TRUE. The median is $1,371, but we cannot know how many tickets are above or below this value."  
     - Score: 2/4  
     - Rationale: The answer is correct, but the explanation misunderstands the concept of the median.

3. **Incorrect Answer but Some Understanding of the Median**  
   - Example: "FALSE. The median is the middle value, but it does not mean 50% of tickets are above $1,371."  
     - Score: 1/4  
     - Rationale: The answer is incorrect, but the explanation shows some understanding of the median.

4. **Correct Answer but Poorly Worded Explanation**  
   - Example: "TRUE. Median means half the tickets are above or below $1,371."  
     - Score: 3.5/4  
     - Rationale: The answer is correct, and the explanation is mostly accurate, but the wording is unclear or imprecise.

## Question 5 (4 points)

### Question Text

True/False/Uncertain: The estimate for Rhode Island (the first state in the figure) is statistically significant at the 10% level.

### Rubric

### Grading Rubric for the Question: "The estimate for Rhode Island (the first state in the figure) is statistically significant at the 10% level."

#### Total Points: 4

---

### **1. Correctness of the Answer (2 points)**  
- **+2 points**: The student correctly identifies whether the estimate is statistically significant at the 10% level (True/False/Uncertain).  
  - **True** is the correct answer, as the 95% confidence interval does not include zero, and the interval would shrink at the 10% level, making the result statistically significant.  
- **+1 point**: The student provides an answer that is plausible but incomplete or unclear (e.g., "Uncertain" with some reasoning that is partially correct but misses key details).  
- **0 points**: The student provides an incorrect answer (e.g., "False") or does not justify their answer at all.

---

### **2. Explanation of Statistical Significance (2 points)**  
- **+2 points**: The student provides a clear and accurate explanation of statistical significance, including:  
  - The relationship between confidence intervals and statistical significance.  
  - The fact that a 95% confidence interval not containing zero implies statistical significance at the 5% level, and that a 90% confidence interval would shrink, further supporting significance at the 10% level.  
- **+1 point**: The explanation is partially correct but incomplete or contains minor errors. For example:  
  - The student mentions confidence intervals but does not explicitly connect the shrinking of the interval at the 10% level to statistical significance.  
  - The student mentions p-values but does not fully explain their relationship to confidence intervals or statistical significance.  
- **0 points**: The explanation is incorrect, irrelevant, or missing. For example:  
  - The student incorrectly describes how confidence intervals or p-values work.  
  - The student provides no reasoning or justification.

---

### **Common Mistakes and Deductions**  
- **-1 point**: Misunderstanding the relationship between confidence intervals and statistical significance (e.g., claiming that a narrower interval makes it harder to achieve significance).  
- **-1 point**: Incorrectly stating that the 95% confidence interval directly determines significance at the 10% level without considering the shrinking of the interval.  
- **-1 point**: Focusing solely on p-values without connecting them to the confidence interval provided in the question.  
- **-1 point**: Misinterpreting the question or providing an irrelevant explanation (e.g., discussing unrelated statistical concepts).  

---

### **Examples of Scoring**

#### **Sample Answer 1:**
- **Answer**: UNCERTAIN.  
- **Explanation**: "At the 10% significance level, the confidence interval becomes narrower, making it easier to include the null value. Since the 95% confidence interval does not include zero, it is possible but not certain that the result is statistically significant at the 10% level."  
- **Score**: 2/4  
  - **+1 point** for a plausible but incorrect answer ("Uncertain").  
  - **+1 point** for mentioning confidence intervals and significance but incorrectly stating that a narrower interval makes it easier to include the null value (misunderstanding the relationship).  
  - **-1 point** for the incorrect reasoning about the shrinking interval.  
  - **-1 point** for failing to conclude that the result is statistically significant at the 10% level.

---

#### **Sample Answer 2:**
- **Answer**: TRUE.  
- **Explanation**: "Since the 95% CI does not contain zero, we reject the null hypothesis. The change in mortality rate after Medicaid expansion is statistically significant."  
- **Score**: 3/4  
  - **+2 points** for the correct answer ("True").  
  - **+1 point** for correctly linking the 95% confidence interval to rejecting the null hypothesis.  
  - **-1 point** for failing to explicitly explain how the interval would shrink at the 10% level, which is key to the reasoning.

---

#### **Sample Answer 3:**
- **Answer**: UNCERTAIN.  
- **Explanation**: "In order to know whether the value is statistically significant, you would have to know whether the p-value is less than the alpha level, in this case 0.10."  
- **Score**: 2/4  
  - **+1 point** for a plausible but incorrect answer ("Uncertain").  
  - **+1 point** for mentioning p-values and alpha levels, which are relevant concepts.  
  - **-1 point** for failing to connect the confidence interval to statistical significance.  
  - **-1 point** for not recognizing that the shrinking interval at the 10% level implies significance.

---

#### **Sample Answer 4:**
- **Answer**: TRUE.  
- **Explanation**: "The 95% confidence interval for Rhode Island is between -124.3 to -3.2. To understand whether this estimate is statistically significant at the 10% level, this range will shrink because the estimate can be wrong more often. Because the 95% confidence interval for Rhode Island is already below 0 and because the interval range will only further shrink, the estimate for Rhode Island is statistically significant at the 10% level."  
- **Score**: 4/4  
  - **+2 points** for the correct answer ("True").  
  - **+2 points** for a clear and accurate explanation, including the shrinking of the interval at the 10% level and its implications for statistical significance.

---

### **Summary of Point Allocations**
- **Correctness of the Answer**: 2 points.  
- **Explanation of Statistical Significance**: 2 points.  
- **Deductions for Common Mistakes**: -1 point per error, up to a maximum of -2 points per category.

#### **Point Allocation Breakdown**
1. **Correct Identification of "Uncertain" as the Answer (1 point)**
   - +1 point for correctly identifying "Uncertain" as the appropriate response.
   - 0 points if the answer is "True" or "False."

2. **Explanation of Statistical Significance (2 points)**
   - +2 points for explicitly stating that the 95% confidence interval (-39.6, 5.4) includes zero, which means the result is not statistically significant.
   - +1 point for mentioning the lack of statistical significance but failing to explicitly connect it to the confidence interval or the inclusion of zero.
   - 0 points for failing to address statistical significance or the confidence interval.

3. **Consideration of Practical Significance (1 point)**
   - +1 point for acknowledging that practical significance (e.g., the magnitude of the change) should also be considered, even if the result is not statistically significant.
   - 0 points for failing to mention practical significance.

4. **Clarity and Logical Reasoning (2 points)**
   - +2 points for providing a clear, logical explanation that ties together statistical significance, practical significance, and the uncertainty of the result.
   - +1 point for a partially clear explanation that addresses some, but not all, of these elements or contains minor logical inconsistencies.
   - 0 points for unclear or illogical reasoning.

---

#### **What Earns Full Credit (+Points)**

- **+1 point**: Correctly identifies "Uncertain" as the answer.
- **+2 points**: Explains that the confidence interval (-39.6, 5.4) includes zero, indicating no statistically significant change.
- **+1 point**: Mentions the importance of practical significance in interpreting the result.
- **+2 points**: Provides a clear, logical explanation that ties together statistical significance, practical significance, and the uncertainty of the result.

**Example of a Full-Credit Answer:**
"UNCERTAIN. The 95% confidence interval for New Mexico (-39.6, 5.4) includes zero, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests no statistically significant change in mortality. However, practical significance should also be considered, as the wide confidence interval could still imply meaningful changes in mortality rates."

### **Examples of Full and Partial Credit**

#### **Full Credit (12/12)**
- The response is well-organized and makes three distinct observations:
  1. The overall result shows a statistically significant reduction in mortality (-11.8), supporting the authors' claim.
  2. There is variability across states and regions, with some states showing statistically significant reductions and others not, which weakens the claim.
  3. While only a few states show statistically significant reductions, many states show decreases in mortality that may still be practically significant, adding nuance to the claim.
- The response is clear, connects observations to the authors' claim, and provides additional insight (e.g., mentions states with increases in mortality).

#### **Partial Credit (8/12)**
- The response is somewhat organized but lacks clarity in phrasing.
- Three observations are made, but one is repetitive or not distinct.
- Example observations:
  1. The overall result shows a statistically significant reduction in mortality (-11.8).
  2. Some states show statistically significant reductions, but others do not.
  3. The Northeast region shows larger reductions compared to the West, but this is not fully explained.
- The response does not distinguish between statistical and practical significance or fails to provide additional insight.

#### **Low Credit (4/12)**
- The response is disorganized and makes only two observations, one of which is vague or incorrect.
- Example observations:
  1. The overall result shows a reduction in mortality.
  2. Some states have different results, but this is not explained.
- The response does not connect observations to the authors' claim or misinterprets the data.

---

### **Key Notes for Graders**
- Ensure that all three observations are distinct and relevant to the question.
- Look for connections between observations and the authors' claim.
- Deduct points for misinterpretations, lack of clarity, or failure to address key aspects of the data (e.g., statistical significance, variability).

  - Correctly identifies the scenarios in which Danica ends up without a job (e.g., rejecting offers in both rounds).
  - Accurately calculates or references the probability of these scenarios adding up to 7%.
  - Example: "Danica ends up without a job in scenarios like (Good, Poor), (Fair, Poor), and (Poor, Poor), which have a combined probability of 0.07 or 7%."

- **+2 Points for Utility-Based Decision-Making:**
  - Explains Danica's strategy of maximizing expected utility and how it influences her decisions in each round.
  - Includes specific utility values (e.g., 4 for 'Excellent,' -1 for 'Poor') and explains why she rejects or accepts offers based on these values.

## Question 11 (5 points)

### Question Text

You believe that Danica has overestimated the quality of the job offer that she will get in Round 2. How could that affect her decision making in Round 1? Under what specific circumstances?

### Rubric

### Grading Rubric for Question: "How could overestimating the quality of the Round 2 job offer affect Danica's decision-making in Round 1? Under what specific circumstances?"

---

#### **Point Allocation Breakdown (Total: 5 points)**

1. **Explanation of the Impact on Decision-Making (2 points)**
   - +2 points: Clearly explains how overestimating the quality of the Round 2 job offer affects Danica's decision-making in Round 1. The answer should explicitly connect the overestimation to changes in Danica's behavior (e.g., increased likelihood of accepting a Round 1 offer or becoming more risk-averse).
   - +1 point: Provides a partial explanation but lacks clarity or depth (e.g., mentions that Danica's decision-making will change but does not specify how or why).
   - 0 points: Fails to address how overestimation affects decision-making or provides an irrelevant or incorrect explanation.

2. **Incorporation of Expected Utility Framework (2 points)**
   - +2 points: Correctly incorporates the concept of expected utility to explain Danica's decision-making process. This includes discussing how the perceived utility of Round 1 offers changes relative to the (overestimated) utility of Round 2 offers.
   - +1 point: Mentions expected utility but does not fully or accurately apply it to the scenario (e.g., vague references to utility without connecting it to decision-making).
   - 0 points: Does not mention or incorrectly applies the concept of expected utility.

3. **Specific Circumstances (1 point)**
   - +1 point: Identifies specific circumstances under which Danica's decision-making would change (e.g., the quality of Round 1 offers, the revised expected utility of Round 2 offers).
   - 0 points: Fails to mention specific circumstances or provides irrelevant or incorrect circumstances.

---

#### **What Earns Full Credit (+Points)**

- **+2 points for Explanation of Impact on Decision-Making:**
  - The answer should clearly describe how overestimating Round 2 offers affects Danica's behavior in Round 1. For example, "Danica may become more likely to accept a 'Fair' or 'Good' job in Round 1 because she overestimates the quality of Round 2 offers and adjusts her expectations accordingly."

- **+2 points for Incorporation of Expected Utility Framework:**
  - The answer should explicitly use the concept of expected utility to explain Danica's decision-making. For example, "If Danica overestimates the utility of Round 2 offers, the expected utility of rejecting a Round 1 offer decreases, making her more likely to accept a Round 1 offer."

- **+1 point for Specific Circumstances:**
  - The answer should provide concrete examples of circumstances that influence Danica's decision-making. For example, "If the expected utility of Round 2 offers is revised downward to between 1 and 2, Danica should accept a 'Good' job in Round 1."

---

#### **Common Mistakes and Misconceptions (-Points)**

1. **Failure to Address Decision-Making (-1 to -2 points)**
   - -1 point: The answer vaguely mentions that Danica's decision-making will change but does not explain how or why.
   - -2 points: The answer fails to address decision-making entirely or provides an irrelevant explanation.

2. **Misuse or Omission of Expected Utility (-1 to -2 points)**
   - -1 point: The answer mentions expected utility but applies it incorrectly or incompletely (e.g., does not connect it to the decision-making process).
   - -2 points: The answer does not mention expected utility at all or fundamentally misunderstands the concept.

3. **Lack of Specific Circumstances (-1 point)**
   - -1 point: The answer does not provide specific circumstances or provides irrelevant or incorrect examples.

4. **Overgeneralization or Incorrect Assumptions (-1 point)**
   - -1 point: The answer makes overly broad or incorrect assumptions (e.g., "Danica will always accept a Round 1 offer" without considering the quality of the offers).

---

#### **Point Allocation Breakdown**
1. **Understanding the relationship between confidence intervals and statistical significance (2 points)**
2. **Correctly interpreting whether the null hypothesis is included in the interval (1 point)**
3. **Clarity and accuracy of explanation (1 point)**

---

### **Detailed Rubric**

#### **1. Understanding the relationship between confidence intervals and statistical significance (2 points)**
- **+2 points**: The response explicitly states that statistical significance is determined by whether the null hypothesized value (e.g., 30%) lies within the confidence interval. If the null value is outside the interval, the result is statistically significant; if it is inside, it is not statistically significant.
- **+1 point**: The response mentions the connection between confidence intervals and statistical significance but lacks clarity or precision (e.g., does not explicitly state the role of the null hypothesis or misuses terminology).
- **0 points**: The response does not address the relationship between confidence intervals and statistical significance or provides an incorrect explanation.

#### **2. Correctly interpreting whether the null hypothesis is included in the interval (1 point)**
- **+1 point**: The response correctly identifies whether the null hypothesized value (e.g., 30%) is inside or outside the given confidence interval and draws the correct conclusion about statistical significance.
- **0 points**: The response fails to correctly interpret whether the null value is inside or outside the interval, or does not address this aspect.

#### **3. Clarity and accuracy of explanation (1 point)**
- **+1 point**: The response is clear, concise, and free of major errors or irrelevant information. It uses appropriate statistical terminology (e.g., "null hypothesis," "confidence interval," "statistical significance") correctly.
- **0.5 points**: The response is mostly clear but contains minor errors, imprecise language, or unnecessary information that detracts from the explanation.
- **0 points**: The response is unclear, contains significant errors, or uses incorrect terminology.

---

### **Common Mistakes and Deductions**
- **-1 point**: Misinterpreting the confidence interval (e.g., claiming it represents the probability that the true value lies within the interval, which is a common misconception).
- **-1 point**: Failing to mention the null hypothesis or its role in determining statistical significance.
- **-1 point**: Incorrectly stating that statistical significance depends on a "threshold" unrelated to the null hypothesis or confidence interval.
- **-0.5 points**: Using vague or imprecise language that makes the explanation difficult to follow (e.g., "the interval shows the result is significant" without explaining why).
- **-0.5 points**: Including irrelevant or incorrect information that detracts from the main point (e.g., discussing repeated sampling without connecting it to the question).

---

### **Examples of Scoring Using the Rubric**

#### **Sample Answer 1**
> "The confidence interval contains the null hypothesized proportion of 30%, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means we are fairly confident that the true proportion lies within the interval."
- **Understanding relationship (2 points)**: +2 points. The response correctly connects statistical significance to whether the null hypothesis is inside the interval.
- **Interpreting inclusion of null (1 point)**: +1 point. The response correctly identifies that the null value (30%) is within the interval.
- **Clarity and accuracy (1 point)**: +0.5 points. The explanation is mostly clear but includes unnecessary language about being "fairly confident," which is not directly relevant to statistical significance.
- **Total: 3.5/4 points**

#### **Sample Answer 2**
> "If we took many repeated samples, we expect 95% of the confidence intervals to contain the true proportion of Americans who expect prices to stay the same or go down. The interval [0.2971, 0.3029] does not include 0, providing evidence that this plausible range captures the true proportion."
- **Understanding relationship (2 points)**: +1 point. The response discusses repeated sampling but does not connect this to statistical significance or the null hypothesis.
- **Interpreting inclusion of null (1 point)**: +0 points. The response incorrectly states that the interval does not include 0, which is irrelevant to the null hypothesis of 30%.
- **Clarity and accuracy (1 point)**: +0.5 points. The explanation is somewhat clear but includes irrelevant information about repeated sampling and misinterprets the interval.
- **Total: 1.5/4 points**

#### **Sample Answer 3**
> "Statistical significance depends on whether the null hypothesis lies within the confidence interval. If it does, the result is not statistically significant."
- **Understanding relationship (2 points)**: +2 points. The response correctly explains the relationship between confidence intervals and statistical significance.
- **Interpreting inclusion of null (1 point)**: +0.5 points. The response does not explicitly state whether the null value is inside or outside the interval but implies understanding.
- **Clarity and accuracy (1 point)**: +1 point. The explanation is clear and concise.
- **Total: 3.5/4 points**

#### **Sample Answer 4**
> "We cannot determine whether the result is 'statistically significant' because we do not know the threshold to which a correlation with actual inflation shows up. If the threshold is at 50%, for example, we can say that the result is statistically significant. But if the threshold is at 30%, we cannot determine statistical significance because the threshold falls within the 95% confidence interval."
- **Understanding relationship (2 points)**: +0 points. The response incorrectly ties statistical significance to an arbitrary "threshold" rather than the null hypothesis.
- **Interpreting inclusion of null (1 point)**: +0 points. The response does not correctly interpret the inclusion of the null hypothesis in the interval.
- **Clarity and accuracy (1 point)**: +0.5 points. The explanation is somewhat clear but fundamentally flawed in its reasoning.
- **Total: 0.5/4 points**

## Question 17 (4 points)

### Question Text

What does this confidence interval suggest about the effectiveness of the gratitude condition as compared to the neutral condition?

### Rubric

### Grading Rubric for Confidence Interval Question (4 Points Total)

#### **Overview**
This rubric evaluates the student's ability to interpret a confidence interval in the context of comparing the effectiveness of the gratitude condition to the neutral condition. The rubric allocates points based on the accuracy, clarity, and completeness of the explanation.

---

### **Point Allocations**

#### **1. Correctly Identifying Whether the Confidence Interval Contains Zero (1 Point)**
- **+1 point**: The student correctly identifies whether the confidence interval contains zero (e.g., "The interval does not contain zero").
- **0 points**: The student incorrectly states that the confidence interval contains zero or does not address this aspect.

#### **2. Correctly Interpreting the Statistical Significance (1 Point)**
- **+1 point**: The student correctly concludes that the absence of zero in the confidence interval indicates statistical significance (e.g., "We reject the null hypothesis" or "The result is statistically significant").
- **0 points**: The student fails to mention statistical significance, incorrectly interprets it, or states that the result is not significant when the interval does not contain zero.

#### **3. Correctly Explaining the Direction of the Effect (1 Point)**
- **+1 point**: The student correctly interprets the direction of the effect based on the confidence interval (e.g., "The gratitude condition reduces craving compared to the neutral condition").
- **0 points**: The student fails to mention the direction of the effect, provides an incorrect direction, or does not address this aspect.

#### **4. Clear and Accurate Use of Evidence from the Confidence Interval (1 Point)**
- **+1 point**: The student explicitly references the confidence interval values (e.g., "[1.858, 15.992]") or the observed difference (e.g., "-5.95") to support their conclusion.
- **0 points**: The student does not reference the confidence interval values or provides incorrect/confusing numerical evidence.

---

### **Common Mistakes and Deductions**

#### **1. Misinterpreting the Confidence Interval**
- **-1 point**: The student incorrectly states that the confidence interval contains zero when it does not.
- **-1 point**: The student misinterprets the confidence interval as being above or below zero when it is not.

#### **2. Misstating Statistical Significance**
- **-1 point**: The student incorrectly concludes that the result is not statistically significant when the confidence interval does not contain zero.
- **-1 point**: The student fails to connect the absence of zero in the confidence interval to rejecting the null hypothesis.

#### **3. Failing to Address the Direction of the Effect**
- **-1 point**: The student does not mention whether the gratitude condition increases or decreases craving compared to the neutral condition.
- **-1 point**: The student provides an incorrect direction of the effect (e.g., stating that the gratitude condition increases craving when it reduces it).

#### **4. Lack of Evidence or Incorrect Use of Evidence**
- **-1 point**: The student does not reference the confidence interval values or the observed difference to support their conclusion.
- **-1 point**: The student provides incorrect or irrelevant numerical evidence.

---

### **Criteria for Partial Credit**

#### **1. Partial Understanding of Statistical Significance**
- **+0.5 points**: The student correctly identifies that the confidence interval does not contain zero but does not explicitly state that this implies statistical significance.

#### **2. Partial Understanding of the Direction of the Effect**
- **+0.5 points**: The student correctly identifies that the gratitude condition has an effect but does not clearly state the direction (e.g., "There is an effect" without specifying reduction in craving).

#### **3. Partial Use of Evidence**
- **+0.5 points**: The student references the confidence interval values but does not fully connect them to the conclusion.

---
